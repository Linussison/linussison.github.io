Hi! I'm Linus, a B.Sc. Applied Physics graduate from the University of the Philippines Diliman. My undergraduate research focused on the applications of semiconductor lasers (SLs) with optical feedback. I used SLs to measure displacements 100 times thinner than human hair and to generate terahertz pulses for low-cost spectrometers.

My research interests are optical sensing, microscopy, and biomedical optics.

When I'm not slogging away in the optics laboratory, I play tennis, read books, and build radios.
